                born in england, i discovered my passion for football (soccer) at an early age, an enthusiasm that has defined much of my life. as a lifelong and devoted manchester united fan, the sport has not only been a source of entertainment but also a way to connect with others across borders. my journey took me to canada during my formative years, where i embraced a new identity as a proud canadian.

                my high school years at sullivan heights secondary were marked by creative endeavors. in my junior year, i took on the role of designing the yearbook, a responsibility that continued into my senior year with the design of graduation hoodies and all visual aspects of our graduation ceremony. my dedication was acknowledged with a scholarship from friesens, the publishers of the yearbook.

                while initially drawn to political science in university, my trajectory shifted when i delved into the world of coding. starting with the basics of html and css, i found my passion for computing science and interactive arts and technology. my academic journey fueled my desire to create meaningful applications that enhance daily lives. i set ambitious goals to develop an app for both apple and google play stores, combining my newfound coding skills with my lifelong love for design.

                currently focused on expanding my expertise in javascript and react, my interests lie in ui and ux design. i am fascinated by the intricacies of user interaction within applications and the importance of creating an intuitive user experience. looking ahead, i aspire to contribute my skills to major players in the tech industry, with a dream of working at ea sports on fifa or at apple, shaping the future of mobile and web-based applications. my journey in the world of technology is not just a career path; it's a pursuit of lifelong goals and a commitment to making a positive impact through innovative and user-friendly solutions.
